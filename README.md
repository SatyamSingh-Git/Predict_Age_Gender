# Age and Gender Prediction Using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to predict the age and gender of multiple people simultaneously in real-time through a camera feed.

## Features
- Real-time age and gender prediction for multiple people in the camera frame.
- Uses pre-trained deep learning models for facial feature analysis.
- Implements a command-line interface (CLI) with Argparse for flexible input handling.
- Optimized for speed and accuracy with webcam integration.

## Technologies
- **OpenCV**: For facial detection and real-time video processing.
- **Argparse**: For creating a flexible command-line interface.
- **Python**: The core programming language.
